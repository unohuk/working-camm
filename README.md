To use this you need to copy the code and make a new bookmark, 
then paste the code into the url of the bookmark.

To use the script go into campus, click a chapter then click the bookmark that you saved.
Currently only works on fill in questions, this means that it will show an error on questions that require you to click a box.

If you are on a school chromebook then you will need to use this virtual browser
